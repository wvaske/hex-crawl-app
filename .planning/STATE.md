## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Multi-scale zoom (ZOOM-01/02/03), encounter tables (ENC-01/02), terrain painting (PAINT-01), and travel/weather mechanics deferred to v2
- [Roadmap]: Phase 6 (Map Image Upload) depends only on Phase 1, enabling parallel execution with Phases 2-5
- [01-01]: Flat-top hex orientation (Orientation.FLAT) following D&D convention
- [01-01]: 40px circumradius default for hex size
- [01-01]: topLeft origin + offset -1 for PixiJS sprite alignment
- [01-01]: JSON format for map import/export (no YAML dependency)
- [01-01]: Tailwind CSS v4 via @tailwindcss/vite plugin (CSS-first config)
- [01-01]: Zustand stores use new Map/Set instances for reactivity
- [01-03]: Seed-and-grow BFS with ~15% seed rate, distance-decay growth (70/50/30/15%)
- [01-03]: Post-processing pass ensures water-coast adjacency after BFS
- [01-03]: 6 primary terrain seeds; coast generated by adjacency rules
- [01-03]: SidePanel tabs: Info, Terrain, Create, Import/Export
- [01-03]: Tailwind dark theme: bg-gray-800/700 panels, bg-gray-900 main, text-gray-100/200/300
